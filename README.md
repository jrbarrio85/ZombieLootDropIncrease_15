-Initial upload

This will increase the chances of zombies dropping loot upon death, from 2% to 15%.
Also adds to the delay of a loot bag despawning, from 5 to 15 minutes
Works with latest A17

NOTE: More loot sitting around longer can add up on an arduous night, this may affect your performance when there are a lot of loot bags sitting around. So loot responsibly and pick that bag up!
